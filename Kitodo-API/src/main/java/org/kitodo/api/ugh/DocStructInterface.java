 * A DocStruct object represents a structure entity in work. Every document

 * This class contains methods to:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Retrieve information about the structure (add, move and remove children),
 * <li>set the parent (the top element has no parent),
 * <li>set and retrieve metadata, which describe a structure entity,
 * <li>handle content files, which are linked to a structure entity.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Every structure entity is of a special kind. The kind of entity is stored in
 * a {@code DocStructType} element. Depending on the type of structure entities
 * certain metadata and children a permitted or forbidden.
