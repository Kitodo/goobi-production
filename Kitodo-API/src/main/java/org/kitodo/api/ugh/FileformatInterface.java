/**
 * A file format is an abstract description of a serialization of a complete
 * {@code DigitalDocument}. A file format may store or read a
 * {@code DigitalDocument} object to/from a file.
 *
 * <p>
 * Depending on the implementation a file format may store all or only part of
 * the information.
 *
 * <p>
 * Every file format may have methods to load, save or update a file. In an
 * implementation not all methods need to be available. Certain file formats are
 * just readable; other may not be updateable.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Differences between readable, updateable, writeable:</b>
 * <ul>
 * <li>readable: the file format can be read from a file
 * <li>updateable: after reading a file format, some information can be updated.
 * The result can be written back (to the same file).
 * <li>writeable: a {@code DigitalDocument} can be written to a completely new
 * file.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Internally, every file format has a digital document instance, which will be
 * created while reading a file successfully. This instance can be obtained by
 * calling {@code getDigitalDocument()}. Before writing a file, a
 * DigitalDocument instance must be available.
