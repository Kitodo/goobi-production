                         Web service to finalize steps

Goobi.Production is equiped with a web service interface to automatically
finalize steps. This allows external software contributing to a workflow to
report their success from outside the application. Additionally, properties
can be populated and a message can be added to the processes’ log (in former
versions of Goobi known as “wiki field”).

The web service infrastructure is provided by an Active MQ server (see
http://activemq.apache.org/ for details) which needs to be downloaded and
started. Without further configuration, it provides everything necessary on
port 61616 of the machine in question.

The “activeMQ.hostURL” must be set in GoobiConfig.properties to point to this
server. The “activeMQ.finaliseStep.queue” must be set to point to a queue
of your choice where Goobi.Production shall pick up orders to finalize steps.

Orders must be javax.jms.MapMessage objects with the following key-value-pairs
provided:

	String id
		ID of the step to close (do not mix up with the process ID)
	Map<String, String> properties (optional)
		May be used to populates properties
	String message
		Message to be added to the processes’ log.

See web_service_to_create_new_processes.txt for an example command line
interface to create such messages.
