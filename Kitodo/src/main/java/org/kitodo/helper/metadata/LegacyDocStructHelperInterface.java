/**
 * One node of a tree depicting the structure of the document.

 * A DocStruct object represents a structure entity in work. Every document
 * consists of a structure, which can be separated into several structure
 * entities, which build hierarchical structure. Usually a
 * {@code DigitalDocument} contains two structures; a logical and a physical
 * one. Each structure consists of a top DocStruct element that is embedded in
 * some kind of structure. This structure is represented by parent and children
 * of {@code DocStruct} objects.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class contains methods to:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Retrieve information about the structure (add, move and remove children),
 * <li>set the parent (the top element has no parent),
 * <li>set and retrieve meta-data, which describe a structure entity,
 * <li>handle content files, which are linked to a structure entity.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Every structure entity is of a special kind. The kind of entity is stored in
 * a {@code DocStructType} element. Depending on the type of structure entities
 * certain meta-data and children a permitted or forbidden.
